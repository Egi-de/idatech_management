# IDA Tech Management - Bulk Delete Students Implementation

## Task: Implement Bulk Delete Functionality for Students

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Updated `templates/admin_panel/index.html` to add select button, checkboxes, and delete selected button in students table
- [x] Updated `static/ui-interactions.js` to handle select button toggle, checkbox selection, and bulk delete functionality
- [x] Verified `admin_panel/views.py` already has bulk_delete_students view implemented
- [x] Verified `admin_panel/urls.py` already has bulk_delete_students URL configured
- [x] Added reports section with buttons for different report types (students, employees, expenses, transactions)

### Features Implemented:
- Select button toggles visibility of checkboxes in students table
- Individual student checkboxes can be selected/deselected
- Select All checkbox selects/deselects all visible student checkboxes
- Delete Selected button appears when selection mode is active and students are selected
- Bulk delete sends selected student IDs to backend via AJAX
- Backend processes bulk delete and saves deleted items to trash bin
- Recent activity is created for bulk delete operations
- Reports section with buttons to switch between different report views

### Technical Details:
- Uses JavaScript to toggle checkbox visibility and handle selection logic
- AJAX request sends JSON payload with student IDs to bulk delete endpoint
- Backend uses Django's bulk delete and saves to TrashBinEntry before deletion
- CSRF token handling for secure AJAX requests
- Error handling and user confirmation for delete operations

### Next Steps:
- Test the functionality by running the Django server
- Verify that the select button toggles checkbox visibility
- Test selecting individual students and using select all functionality
- Test bulk delete operation and confirm students are moved to trash bin
- Test reports section button functionality
